### What is this?
Not really a trader or gamer myself, but I wonder of Steam Market. Can I scan (scrape) and analyze it for profitable trades? I imagine that quickly finding items with large and often price fluctuations might be of some use. Well, that's the idea.

### Getting started
It's really straight forward. Just run it `npm install` to get dependencies and `node index.js` to start the app on `localhost:80`.
